Notes;
had only about one instance where props had to be passed down two levels down the component tree , therefore no sufficient reason to use context or a third party state management lib like redux

will make the project responsive

will declare custom tailwind directives to reduce repeated use of certain tailwind utility classes

why I didnt batch the requests on the home page together

used react apexcharts as it offers extra things like zoom, pan and download data as csv

why I used interfaces mainly for api responses as those are usually shaped like objects and types for component props typing

use a better third party lib to handle dynamic application of classes
